# The DevOps Lounge (TDOL)

This repository contains documentation pertaining to the The DevOps Lounge Discord community, which can be joined via this link: https://discord.gg/MTzBvSS

Our community is centered around learning, sharing ideas, inclusiveness and professionalism. If you're not in the IT industry but you're looking to get into it then you're welcome here. If you're already in the IT industry and have experience and knowledge to share, then you're also welcome.

What our community is not is a place for general chit chat (although we do have a limit number of channels for that), politics, memes, music bots, debate, hate or just about anything that's not really welcoming, about learning or IT related.

Please consult the `rules.md` file before connecting to the server. The rules are repeated when you join but it's good to be familiar ahead of time to ensure this community is for you.

## Sponsorship

The server is currently self-sponsored by its founder, Michael Crilly, using profits obtained via his business, OpsFactory Pty Ltd.
