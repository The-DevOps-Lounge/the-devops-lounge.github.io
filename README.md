# The DevOps Lounge

The DevOps Lounge is a Discord community and this repository contains documentation pertaining to that community, which can be joined via this link: [Discord - Click Me!](https://discord.gg/MTzBvSS)

Our community is centered around learning, sharing ideas, inclusiveness and professionalism. If you're not in the IT industry but you're looking to get into it then you're welcome here. If you're already in the IT industry and have experience and knowledge to share, then you're also welcome.

What our community is not is a place for general chit chat (although we do have a limit number of channels for that), politics, memes, music bots, debate, hate or just about anything that's not really welcoming, about learning or IT related.

Please consult the [rules](/rules.md) file before connecting to the server. The rules are repeated when you join but it's good to be familiar ahead of time to ensure this community is for you.

## Rules

The community has some basic rules in place. These should be simple enough to follow along with:

1. No political debates are welcome here. There are other, better servers for that;
1. No abusive behaviour towards other users including, but not limited to, name calling, shaming, emotional manipulation, and so on;
1. No hate speech of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, racism, transphobia, sexism, homophobia;
1. No pornographic content in any channel;
1. No illegal content such as sharing software cracks, registration keys, patched software that bypasses DRM, and other obviously illegal activities;
1. No excessive or obnoxious use of foul language. It’s low brow and you’re more intelligent than that. (And no, swearing is not “what makes us Australian.”);
1. The administrative/moderation team have the right to remove messages they feel breech any of the above rules. Although their say is NOT final, and you can appeal it, try to avoid getting into that situation to begin with;
1. If it isn’t about technology or it's a joke/meme, then it goes in #off-topic - let's keep #general and other channels on topic;
1. The #blackhole channel is for debates that have gone off on a tangent like an IRC channel from way back when you were a kid. Enjoy.

These rules may change and we'll try to give you notice ahead of time and after any changes.

If you need assistance you can contact @Michael Crilly (the founder and admin of this server) or ping the @Moderator role.

Have fun! :-)

## Promotion

As people use the server by engaging in conversation with others they gain experience with the Mee6 bot. The bot keeps track of your progress as a user of the server and assigns you levels. These levels have an important role in how you'll (eventually) be preceived by the rest of the community. As it stands now we have three tiers that a member of the community can be promoted to automatically:

1. Regular = `5`
1. Member = `15`
1. Veteran = `30`

The numbers in the brackets alongside the tier represent the level one has to achieve with Mee6 to automatically gain that tier. So `5` means once Mee6 annouces that you've reached level `5` you'll be assigned the `Member` role automatically, giving others a visual cue that you've been connected to the server and active for a decent amount of time.

### Professionals
There is also a fourth rank, `Professional`, that is by invite only and at the discretion of the server's staff. Anyone with this rank is a proven professional in the field and has been shown to be mature and helpful. Members at this rank get access to a private channel for other professionals in the industry.

## Bots

We have a few bots connected to the server 24/7:

- SHODAN (Mee6)
- DISBOARD
- MonitoRSS

The SHODAN bot (A.I.) is a general purpose Discord bot that's for managing the server, keeping track of user's interactions and awarding them with levels as they stay active (see [promotion](/promotion.md)). The bot is also used for automated moderation such as preventing spamming and kicking or banning users who breach these rules.

The DISBOARD bot is a very simple bot that keeps track of the server's population and tracks it on a global, public board.

The MonitoRSS bot is used to grab updates from a select few RSS feeds and update channels in the "RSS FEEDS" category. These feeds are primarily focused on the big three public CLoud providers and their status pages.

## Sponsorship

The server is currently self-sponsored by its founder, Michael Crilly, using profits obtained via his business, [OpsFactory Pty Ltd.](https://www.opsfactory.com.au/)
