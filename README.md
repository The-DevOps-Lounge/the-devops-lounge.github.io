# The DevOps Lounge

The DevOps Lounge is a Discord community focused on DevOps IT practices. Our community can be [accessed via this link.](https://discord.gg/MTzBvSS)

Our community is centered around learning, sharing ideas, inclusiveness and professionalism. If you're not in the IT industry but you're looking to get into it then you're welcome here. If you're already in the IT industry and have experience and knowledge to share, then you're also welcome.

What our community is not is a place for general chit chat (although we do have a limit number of channels for that), politics, memes, music bots, debate, hate or just about anything that's not really welcoming, about learning or IT related.

Please consult the [rules](/rules.md) file before connecting to the server. The rules are repeated when you join but it's good to be familiar ahead of time to ensure this community is for you.

## Promotion

As people use the server by engaging in conversation with others they gain experience with the Mee6 bot. The bot keeps track of your progress as a user of the server and assigns you levels. These levels have an important role in how you'll (eventually) be preceived by the rest of the community. As it stands now we have three tiers that a member of the community can be promoted to automatically:

1. Regular = `5`
1. Member = `15`
1. Veteran = `30`

The numbers in the brackets alongside the tier represent the level one has to achieve with Mee6 to automatically gain that tier. So `5` means once Mee6 annouces that you've reached level `5` you'll be assigned the `Member` role automatically, giving others a visual cue that you've been connected to the server and active for a decent amount of time.

### Professionals

There is also a fourth rank, `Professional`, that is by invite only and at the discretion of the server's staff. Anyone with this rank is a proven professional in the field and has been shown to be mature and helpful. Members at this rank get access to a private channel for other professionals in the industry.

## Bots

We have a few bots connected to the server 24/7:

- SHODAN (Mee6)
- DISBOARD
- MonitoRSS

The SHODAN bot (A.I.) is a general purpose Discord bot that's for managing the server, keeping track of user's interactions and awarding them with levels as they stay active (see [promotion](/promotion.md)). The bot is also used for automated moderation such as preventing spamming and kicking or banning users who breach these rules.

The DISBOARD bot is a very simple bot that keeps track of the server's population and tracks it on a global, public board.

The MonitoRSS bot is used to grab updates from a select few RSS feeds and update channels in the "RSS FEEDS" category. These feeds are primarily focused on the big three public CLoud providers and their status pages.

## Sponsorship

The server is currently self-sponsored by its founder, Michael Crilly, using profits obtained via his business, [OpsFactory Pty Ltd.](https://www.opsfactory.com.au/)
