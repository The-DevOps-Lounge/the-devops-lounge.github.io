# Bots

We have a few bots connected to the server 24/7:

- SHODAN (Mee6)
- DISBOARD
- MonitoRSS

The SHODAN bot (A.I.) is a general purpose Discord bot that's for managing the server, keeping track of user's interactions and awarding them with levels as they stay active (see [promotion](/promotion.md)). The bot is also used for automated moderation such as preventing spamming and kicking or banning users who breach these rules.

The DISBOARD bot is a very simple bot that keeps track of the server's population and tracks it on a global, public board.

The MonitoRSS bot is used to grab updates from a select few RSS feeds and update channels in the "RSS FEEDS" category. These feeds are primarily focused on the big three public CLoud providers and their status pages.
