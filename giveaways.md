The DevOps Lounge (TDOL) community has been setup to encourage others to learn more about DevOps and IT in general. To help people on their path to becoming a DevOp or even just getting into the industry, TDOL runs regular competitions that encourage people to test their skills and show off what they can do. In return for their efforts TDOL awards prizes to the winner as well as runners up.

Prizes include, but aren't limited to:

- Exam vouchers for AWS, Microsoft, Google, CompTIA, etc.
- 3, 6 and 12 month subscriptions to ACloudGuru, Linux Academy, Cloud Academy, CBT Nuggets, and more
- Hardware like GPUs, SSDs and maybe even complete systems

## Competitions

The competitions will generally center around a coding challenge. The idea is to challenge people to push their DevOps skills to the max and produce a solution to a complex problem. An example might be:

> Produce all the relevant Ansible, Terraform and Packer code to deliver a non-HA WordPress installation in AWS, DigitalOcean **and** Azure.

Such a challenge would take several weeks for someone to complete. In the process of completing this challenge they would produce a lot of code. They'd also learn a lot and others will learn a lot from their efforts. The efforts of their labour would then be considered by OpsFactory Pty Ltd (our sponsor), the TDOL staff and the community as a whole (and maybe even people outside the community!)

A decision is reached after all entries have been considered. Prizes are assigned to each participant in accordance with the quality and quantity of their work, as well as their willingness to teach other less able members of the community how their solution works.
